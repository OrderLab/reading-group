# Description

601.817 is a weekly seminar organized by the [OrderLab](https://orderlab.io/).
 It covers latest advances in the research of computer systems including operating systems, 
 distributed system, mobile and cloud computing. Students will read and discuss recent papers 
 in top systems conferences such as OSDI, SOSP, NSDI, EuroSys, MobiSys, ASPLOS and FAST.

Each week, one student will present the paper and lead the discussion for the week. Other students
 **MUST** read the paper to be presented **before** the seminar. Do not come to the seminar to
 read the paper. This seminar is supposed to generate in-depth discussions. It is impossible to do so 
 without reading the paper first. During the reading group discussion, there might be some questions 
 that were left unanswered and required further investigation. In that case, the discussion lead 
 should start a email thread to [systalk@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:systalk@cs.jhu.edu) 
 afterwards to follow up. 

The focus topics covered in the papers vary semester to semester. Example topics include 
 fault-tolerance, reliability, verification, energy efficiency, and virtualization. The presenter 
 decides which paper to present. In general, select
 the papers that are relevant to your research project first (i.e., depth-first). If you are not sure, 
 it is a good idea to check with me first before preparing the presentation. Also, try to avoid picking papers
 that have already been picked in the past (the past schedules are linked on the leftside menu).

The presentation announcements are sent via the mailing list [systalk@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:systalk@cs.jhu.edu).
 Students who registered for the course please email me to sign up for the mailing list.
